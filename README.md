I hope you're doing well. I wanted to bring up a couple of small concerns regarding the food we've been receiving lately.

Firstly, while I appreciate the variety and effort put into the meals, I've noticed that some of them have been quite spicy—more than what many of us are comfortable with. I believe that adjusting the spice level a bit would make the meals more enjoyable for everyone. Perhaps we could consider a milder option or have a range of spice levels available?

Additionally, I’ve noticed that there’s been a shortage of meals on a few occasions, and some team members haven’t been able to get food. If possible, it would be great to increase the number of parcels by 4 or 5 so that everyone can be accommodated.

Thanks for considering this feedback. I think these adjustments would go a long way in ensuring everyone is comfortable and satisfied with the food.
